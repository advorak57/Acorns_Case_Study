# <u>*A Big Pile of Nuts - A Case Study*</u>
---
## *Overview and Origin*
---
- Legal Name: *Acorns Grow Inc.*
- Acorns was incorporated in <u>2012</u> and later launched an app for iOS and Android devices and became known in 2014.
- The founders of Acorns are father and son duo Walter Wemple Cruttenden III and Jeffery Cruttenden. Acorns is now led by current CEO Noah Kerner.
- The idea behind the company was to provide a service and product to consumers with the goal of promoting gradual savings that would lead to passive investing. The idea that your extra change from transactions would get set aside, saved, and invested, leading to accumulation over time. In other words, all your little acorns saved would eventually grow into a big oak tree for you to retire on.
- According to [Crunchbase](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/acorns-grow), since being founded in 2012, Acorns has raised over $500 million through 10 different funding rounds from venture capital funding including support from several [celebrity investors](https://www.acorns.com/about/) as well as large corporate backers like Black Rock Inc and Paypal Holdings Inc. They had plans to release an IPO in 2022 with SPAC Pioneer Merger Corp. in the amount of $2.2 billion but subsequently [cancelled the offering](https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2022/investment-platform-acorns-calls-off-ipo-with-pioneer-spac/) citing market conditions as the primary reason to hault the IPO.

## *Business Activities*
---

- The specific problem Acorns is trying to solve is how to help people who dont have much money, knowledge in investing, or time can still invest and begin saving for retirement. 
- Acorns intended customer is for people who are looking to start investing their money but maybe dont have a large amount of capital to start with or enough education to do it on their own. They also need to be tech savy enough to be comfortable working with apps on their phones. As a result this demographic makeup is primarily Millenials. According to the Fed, Millenials held only [2.5 percent](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/millennial-stock-ownership-minuscule-compared-to-gen-x-boomers-2021-11) of the total shares invested in the stock market as of June 2022. This means that Millenial market share is a fraction of generations prior. Acorns looks to help get the investment ball rolling. Their services allow for their customer's transactions to get rounded up to the nearest dollar, and take the change on each transaction and make micro-investments into established ETF based portfolios created by Acorns and its securities trading partners. They want to make the barrier to entry in investing as small as possible. By automating their trasnaction rounding service, the customer's risiduals from purchases gets invested automatically without the need to reach out to a broker or purchase a security themselves. If so inclined the customer can take advantage of [learning resources](https://www.acorns.com/learn/) available as well if they want to begin building up their knowledge base for investing.

The great advantage that Acorns tries to lean on is that they have set up their model to be passive for the consumer. The headaches that are involved with setting up a budget, conciously saving money for the purpose of investing is no easy task. They take the approach that if you are willing to pay $4.25 for a coffee at Starbucks, you will probably be willing to pay $5.00 and invest the $0.75 difference every time you get one. The same goes for all purchases. By investing directly into ETFs, they make sure the customer has a balanced portfolio no matter the amount of money or lack thereof invested. As what often happens 

- Acorns finds itself operating primarily in Personal Finance and Online Banking. And although Acorns is not a bank, they have partnered with Visa and Lincoln Savings Bank to help them offer debit cards for transactions
